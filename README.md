# FormSchema
A form field was generated by using JSON Schema that was defined for the form by two methods :

1. By using React-JSONschema-form Library :

- in this method, I used the RJSF lib playground to directly generate the form 
- the JSON was converted to JSON SCHEMA using  external JSON to JSON schema converter,
- then the playground directly creates the Schemaform and also gives the Form Data.


2. BY using Formik  in IDE: (IN THE MASTER BRANCH)

- Formik opensource library is used for the form in a react app ,
- Then the JSON Schema is attached to the App.js file ,
- the form is validated ,generated and submmitted.
